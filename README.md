## Introduction

---

Combining the large model (OpenAI-GPT3.5) with the ROS2 (Foxy) communication
framework makes it easy for robot developers to quickly use the large model
for development.

---

## Installation

--- 

1. Create a new ros workspace and enter the space
   ```commandline
    mkdir gpt_ws && cd gpt_ws
    ```
2. Clone the repo to the workspace
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NoneJou072/ROS2-GPT-Interface.git
   ```
3. Change the name of the repo folder to src, and then install related dependencies
    ```
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```
4. build the workspace
    ```
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```
   
## Usage

---
### 1. Change setting
a. rewrite `gpt_client/gpt_client/config.json` fileï¼Œinstead of your openai-key
   ```
   "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<Your openai-key>"
   ```

### 2. Run the node
