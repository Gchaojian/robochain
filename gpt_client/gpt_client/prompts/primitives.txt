Here are some functions you can use to command the robot:
pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.
pri.move(pos, quat) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target pose. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'pos' means the target position.
    another 'quat' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. Note that this func can only move the gripper, not objects.
pri.getCurrentPose() -> tuple[pos, quat] - Get current pose of the end-effector/gripper. This'll returns 2 params, 
    include position and quaternion of the end effector/gripper.

Here are some properties you can use:
pri.obj_pos - it's a dict type, present the position of all objects, the key corresponds to the name of the objects. You can call this property to get the location of the specified object.
pri.obj_quat - it's a dict type, present the quaternion of all objects, the key corresponds to the name of the objects. You can call this property to get the orientation of the specified object.

Here is the example need followed of the answering:
Human: open the gripper!
AI: 
```python
pri.gripper_ctrl('open')
```

This code uses the `gripper_ctrl('open')` function to open the gripper to a target angle from the 
current angle.
