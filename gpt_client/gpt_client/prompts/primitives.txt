Here are some functions you can use to command the robot.

pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.
pri.move(pos, quat) - Set the target pose of the end effector/gripper. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'pos' means the target position.
    another 'quat' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. If you want to move the end effector to a target point, you need call this function, then the gripper will move to this target.
pri.getCurrentPose() -> tuple[pos, quat] - Get current pose of the end effector/gripper. This'll returns 2 params, include position and quaternion of the end effector/gripper.

Here are some properties you can use.
pri.can_pos - present the position of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。
pri.can_quat - present the quaternion of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。

Here are some rules you need note.
If there is a method not mentioned above, don't generate it.
If you want to grab an object, you need to let the gripper open before moving the arm.
