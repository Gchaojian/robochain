Here are some functions you can use to command the robot:
pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.
pri.move(pos, quat) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target pose. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'pos' means the target position.
    another 'quat' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. Note that this func can only move the gripper, not objects.
pri.getCurrentPose() -> tuple[pos, quat] - Get current pose of the end-effector/gripper. This'll returns 2 params, 
    include position and quaternion of the end effector/gripper.

Here are some properties you can use:
pri.can_pos - present the position of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。
pri.can_quat - present the quaternion of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。

Here is an example when the answer contains code:
Human: open the gripper!
AI: 
```python
pri.gripper_ctrl('open')
```

This code uses the `gripper_ctrl('open')` function to open the gripper to a target angle from the 
current angle.
