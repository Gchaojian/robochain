Here are some functions you can use to command the robot:

pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.
pri.move(pos, quat) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target pose. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'pos' means the target position.
    another 'quat' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. Note that this func can only move the gripper, not objects.
pri.getCurrentPose() -> tuple[pos, quat] - Get current pose of the end-effector/gripper. This'll returns 2 params, include position and quaternion of the end effector/gripper.

Here are some properties you can use:

pri.can_pos - present the position of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。
pri.can_quat - present the quaternion of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。

Here are some rules you need to note:

1. Only while picking up the objects, you need to move above the object first, and dont't forget keeping the gripper opened before. Then you can move down to where the object is to grasp.
After grasping the target object, you need to move up some distance, in order to avoid colliding with other objects.

2. If you want to put down the object in the gripper, you need to move above the target point first, then move down to the target, wait unil reach the target you can open the gripper .

3. If you want to move an object to another place, you need pick it up first and continue moving then.
