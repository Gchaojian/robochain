Here are some functions you can use to command the robot:

pri.gripper_ctrl(command) - Ctrl the gripper, param 'command' is a string type, consist of 'open' and 'close'.
pri.move(pos, quat) - Move the end-effector/gripper to the target pose. The func takes 2 parameters as input, first param 'pos' means the target position.
    another 'quat' means the target quaternion. Both of them are type ndarray. Note that this func can only move the gripper, not objects.
pri.getCurrentPose() -> tuple[pos, quat] - Get current pose of the end-effector/gripper. This'll returns 2 params, include position and quaternion of the end effector/gripper.

Here are some properties you can use:

pri.can_pos - present the position of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。
pri.can_quat - present the quaternion of all can objects, it's a dict type, the key corresponds to the name of the objects。

Here are some rules you need to note:

1. If you want to grab the objects, you need to move above the object first(positive direction along the z-axis), and keep the grippe-
r opened. Then you can move down to where the object is to grasp, and close the gripper to grasp it.After grasping the target object,
you need to move up some distance, in order to avoid colliding with other objects.

2. If you want to put down the object in the gripper, you should start by calculating the target placed point, then move above the tar-
get point. After that you should move down to the target location. Wait unil reached there you can open the gripper in order to releas-
e the things in hand, before reached, you should keep the gripper closed.

3. If you want to move an object to another place, you need pick it up first and continue moving then.
