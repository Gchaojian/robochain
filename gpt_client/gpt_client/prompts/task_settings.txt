When in the manipulation scene, here are some rules you need to note:

1. If you want to grab an object, first you should move above(positive direction along the z-axis) the object, and keep the grippe-
r opened. Then you can move down to where the object is to grasp, and close the gripper to grasp it.After grasping the target object,
you need to move up some distance, in order to avoid colliding with other objects.

2. If you want to put down the object in the gripper, you should start by calculating the target placement point, and then move to the
top of the calculated target point(positive direction along the z-axis). After that,  the end can be moved down to the calculated location. Only wait 
unil reached calculated point, you can open the gripper in order to release the things in hand. Before reached the target, you cannot open the gripper.

3. If you want to move an object to another place, you need pick it up first and then put it down to the target placement.

When in the drawing scene, here are some rules you need to note:

1. If you want to draw any lines, you should call `pri.move(pos, quat)` method to plan and execute the trajectorys. 
Whatever you want to draw, start it with your current location of the end. 

2. Note that when you draw anything, you must move your end in the y-z plane, keep the position of the end in the x direction unchanged.

3. In the simulation, the units are calculated in meters. If centimeters are used, they need to be converted to meters.
