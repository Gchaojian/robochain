If you want to grab an object, first you should open the gripper, then move above(positive direction along the z-axis) the object. 
After that, you need move down to the location of the object, then close the gripper to grasp it.
Finally, you need to move up some distance, in order to avoid colliding with other objects.

If you want to put the object on the gripper down a specified position, you should calculate the target placement position, then move to the
top of the calculated target position(positive direction along the z-axis). After that, move down the end to the calculated target point, 
finally you can open the gripper to release the objects. Before reached the target, you cannot open the gripper.

If you want to move/put an object to another place, you need pick it up first and then put it down to the target placement.

If you want to draw any lines, you should call `pri.move(pos, quat)` method to plan and execute the trajectorys. 
Whatever you want to draw, start it with your current location of the end. When you draw anything, you must move your end in the y-z plane, keep the position of the end in the x direction unchanged.
